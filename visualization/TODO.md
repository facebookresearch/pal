## TODO visualization

- [ ] Understand reasons behind loss spikes -> one is due to crossing at zero of vectors that get normalized.

- Finetuning experiments.
- Analyze the different videos.
- Analyze final configurations to distinguish between different final solutions.
- Introduce a measure to distinguish the different final solutions, and see if for a given seed, the types of final solutions we get are somewhat consistent.
- Write the paper.
- Get nice plots for the paper.

#### Vivien's TODO

- Code Amelioration
    - [ ] Write subfunctions for the visualization to be able to pick the ones we want. Load a json config file for the visualization.

- Fine-tuning
    - [ ] write some fine-tuning experiments.
    - [ ] Write visualization when $p=3$ with triangles for the sequence associated to $y = 2$.
