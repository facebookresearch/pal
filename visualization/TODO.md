## TODO visualization

- See percentage of success for finetuning and check where did we start from

- Get the ablation study plots
    - Ablation study with ffn_dim all the way to 10_000
    - Format them nicely for the paper: send data to my computer and plot them with latex fonts.

- Fine-tuning
    - [ ] Write visualization when $p=3$ with triangles for the sequence associated to $y = 2$.


- Analyze final configurations to distinguish between different final solutions.
- Analyze the different videos.
    - why and how do we get to different solutions?
    - why and how do we get loss spikes?
- Write the paper.
- Get nice plots for the paper.
