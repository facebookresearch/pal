iid study
- [x] show that speed depends on the sum of the q_i.
- [ ] show that speed depends on the sum of the p_i.

compression study
- [ ] show the threshold for the embedding dimension compared to the sum of the q_i.
- [ ] study if we go faster if we take a bigger embedding, or more layers / show that the gain disappear if we normalize for flops

generalization study
- [ ] show that the generalization depends on the connectivity in the graph.

other study
- [ ] show that we have not sheet with hyperparameters.
- [ ] show that the user can use our framework to compute other quantities they may found relevant.
