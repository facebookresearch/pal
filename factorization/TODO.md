- Set up experimental pipeline.
- Come with a first set of experiments.
- Refine and Iterate experiments to get insights.


#### We will have different options for the optimization:
- SGD.
- GD.
- GD on population loss (which can be computed in our synthetic setting).
It would be interesting to test which works best.
