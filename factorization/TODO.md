# Concrete stuff
- script to look at the experiments.
     - look at the analysis script, make it a notebook, then put it (partially) back into a script.

- launch some experiments

# High level TODO
- Come with a first set of experiments to illustrate scaling laws, try to make a link between the slopes and various hyperparameters, in particuler some intrinsic properties of the data model.

# Data model
- Add the single-index model variation discussed in the paper.
- Eventually add the graphical model variation discussed in the paper.
