# Concrete stuff
- script to look at the experiments.
     - look at the analysis script, make it a notebook, then put it (partially) back into a script.

- launch compression experiments study:
     - look manually at some good spot in terms of data and model size.

- launch generalization study:
      - look manually at some good spot in term of data split, data size, model size.

- plot some initial scaling curves
- then cross validate the parameters that should be cross-validated
